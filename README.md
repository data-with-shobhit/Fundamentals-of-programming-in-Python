### Topics Covered

1. **Data Types**
   - Understanding different data types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set)
   - Type conversion and type casting

2. **Indexing**
   - Accessing elements in sequences using positive and negative indices
   - Multi-dimensional indexing

3. **Slicing**
   - Extracting sub-parts of sequences using slicing
   - Slicing with step values

4. **Operators**
   - Arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators
   - Operator precedence and associativity

5. **In-built Functions**
   - Using common in-built functions (e.g., `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, `sorted()`)
   - Understanding and utilizing anonymous functions with `lambda`

6. **Statements**
   - Expression and assignment statements
   - Compound statements and suite

7. **Conditionals**
   - Writing conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
   - Nested conditionals and conditional expressions

8. **Loops**
   - Implementing loops using `for` and `while`
   - Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)

9. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Defining and using classes and objects
   - Concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction

10. **Exception Handling**
    - Handling exceptions with `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`
    - Raising and creating custom exceptions
